Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!

There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. What? You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. No! Commence primary ignition.

What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well, who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What are you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?

I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!
